I am a Junior Computer Science major with a concentration in Cyber Security. I initially gained interest in computer science while in high school, not knowing how it would and could potentially shape my career. Computer Science Principles was by far, the hardest class I had ever taken at the time. Despite having no background or previous understanding in the subject, I was intrigued and made a commitment to push through this experience. I completed the course as  one of the top students in the class. From this experience, I evolved into a more confident and focused student having overcome such an obstacle.

In college, I knew I wanted to take my new found passion for computer science to the next level. I began my collegiate studies at North Carolina A&T State University, majoring in Information Technology. However, due to the higher cost of tuition and the limited funding I was able to obtain, I had to transfer to a smaller, local institution, South Carolina State University, where I am now pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 

Initially, It was a challenge seeking out of class experiential learning opportunities at a smaller institution but I have also benefited from the smaller class sizes. All of my teachers know my name and I am able to get hands-on training in cyber security, opportunities to attend conferences and opportunities to speak on the departments behalf for prospective students. I have realized why although 10% of all African Americans attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), they produce 25% of all African American graduates with STEM degrees and are more career ready than those at larger institutions.

I have been able to obtain opportunities such as my current internship at CCNOAI, a startup technology firm, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Among many tasks, I have been given the lead on automating data flow and data governance.

There are many opportunities that interest me by reaching out to you. I am seeking to gain mentorship from role models like yourself and increase my current network with individuals who are where I want to be. I am dedicated to becoming a better person and an advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world. Additionally, I am looking to gain relevant experience and exposure to a variety of company cultures. By starting this process now, I believe I’ll be positioned to provide instant value to an organization upon graduation from South Carolina State University.

As a woman of color, I will be entering an environment where Black, Latinx, and Native American/Alaskan and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women make up less than 3% combined of Silicon Valley’s tech workforce. When it comes to tech leadership positions, black women make up less than 0.5%. It is rare to find someone to look up to that could relate to my experiences as a Computer Science student. I am optimistic that these numbers will increase and I am driven to carry the torch and be an advocate for the next generation of underrepresented women in the STEM field.
